Our core strategies are centred on achieving the ideal position in the market. This is an ongoing process, and we're committed to adjusting as we move forward.

At the moment, every step is bringing the project closer to its core targets. Minterest is focused on future plans that will support a successful launch as we reach important milestones.

Topic: Market Conditions | Category: General | Tags: Development | Answer: Waiting until Minterest’s TVL grows to support a stable, impactful launch makes sense, even if it feels tough, because rushing could weaken the ecosystem’s long-term value—and external market factors may reflect on project growth. We're progressing cautiously, staying mindful of these conditions, and continuously adapting new strategies.

Topic: Exchange Listing | Category: Community | Tags: Partnerships, Development | Answer: Targeting TVL on Minterest to exceed $50M borrow is required to consider listing, focusing on building a robust ecosystem.

Topic: Listing Delay | Category: Product | Tags: Development | Answer: Market volatility in mid-2024 led to the postponement. Now, TVL consolidation requires a focus on product-market fit and driving towards the TVL target for a sustainable token launch. There are no guarantees against delays, but the listing is tied to a TVL milestone for stability. See Q5 in https://minterest.com/blog/ama-recap-product-market-fit/#:~:text=Q5 for steps the project is taking. The team will keep you updated. The wait has been challenging, but 100,000 followers, a peak TVL of $16M, and expansion across four chains show commitment. | Links: https://minterest.com/blog/ama-recap-product-market-fit/?utm_source=chatgpt.com; https://minterest.com/blog/navigating-toward-product-market-fit/; https://minterest.com/blog/minterest-is-moving-forward/ | Text: Explanation: Links delays to PMF and TVL, matching this blog’s focus on market fit and growth metrics.
