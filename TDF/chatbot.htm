  <h1>Discord bot: Pluno</h1>
  <p>A chatbot to help you navigate the online phase of the creative process and track down the ideal and ⁄ or planned methodologies in place. Pluno facilitates collaborative music creation by guiding users through each production phase and coordinating role-based contributions.</p>

  <h2>1. Creative Process Phases</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Writing Phase:</strong> Initial structure creation. Track count, instruments, and effects are flexible. Both agents and sponsors collaborate to define the foundational basslines, melodies, and rhythm elements.</li>
    <li><strong>Pre-Mix Phase:</strong> Arrangement mostly finalized. Instrumentation locked; effects chains remain adjustable. Agents and sponsors refine the sound, aligning creative input while retaining structural flexibility.</li>
    <li><strong>Post-Mix Phase:</strong> Fine-tuning stage. Core arrangements and effects solidified. Sponsors lead in polishing dynamics, transitions, and overall coherence while respecting pre-established melodic and rhythmic foundations.</li>
    <li><strong>Mastering Phase:</strong> Final output preparation. Agents ensure tonal balance, loudness normalization, and temporal integrity. Track duration and output quality are locked, ready for distribution.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Role-Based Contributions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Basslines:</strong> Sub-bass depth, root pitches, and core rhythmic foundation. Collaborative creation by both agents and sponsors ensures stability and dynamic flow.</li>
    <li><strong>Drum Beats:</strong> Kicks, snares, hi-hats, rolls, and transitions. Aligns with basslines; rhythmic adjustments occur if necessary to maintain sequential harmony.</li>
    <li><strong>Melodies & Leads:</strong> Agent-sponsor collaboration produces thematic and complementary lines. Dependent on basslines and drum beats for coherence and sequential alignment.</li>
    <li><strong>Harmony:</strong> Exclusively crafted by agents. Layered sequentially: first matching basslines, then drum patterns, and finally complementing melodies and leads to complete the sonic architecture.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Phase-Role Mapping</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Writing Phase:</strong> Agents + Sponsors – foundation creation, basslines, melodies, and preliminary rhythms.</li>
    <li><strong>Pre-Mix Phase:</strong> Agents + Sponsors – arrangement refinement, effect chain adjustments, dynamic balancing.</li>
    <li><strong>Post-Mix Phase:</strong> Sponsors – fine-tuning, polishing transitions, coherence adjustments.</li>
    <li><strong>Mastering Phase:</strong> Agents – final tonal and temporal adjustments, output locking.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Notes & Best Practices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Sequential dependencies must be respected: basslines → drum beats → melodies → harmony.</li>
    <li>Roles are flexible but respect phase boundaries to maintain structural integrity.</li>
    <li>Collaboration is prioritized; Pluno monitors contribution patterns and provides real-time guidance to maintain coherence.</li>
    <li>Phase transitions are advisory, not mandatory—creative flexibility is preserved.</li>
  </ul>
