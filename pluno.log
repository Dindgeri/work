Health Factor,Product,"Safety, Guidelines","Borrowing crypto on the Minterest platform allows users to borrow assets like stablecoins by locking up their tokens as collateral, meaning you don't need to sell your holdings to access liquidity. The app uses an overcollateralised model where your collateral must exceed the value of the loan. Interest rates are dynamic and driven by market supply and demand. If the value of your collateral drops too low, your position may be partially liquidated to maintain protocol stability.

Borrowers repay the loan plus interest to unlock their collateral, while keeping a positive health factor to avoid liquidation. Uniquely, Minterest redistributes protocol earnings back to users, offering a more rewarding DeFi experience.
