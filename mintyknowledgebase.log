MINTY Token & Listing Strategy:
- MINTY launch requires $50M borrow TVL for liquidity and stability. No confirmed date due to market volatility and competition among 500+ lending protocols. CEX listings ($1M+ cost) prioritized over DEX for broader impact, contingent on TVL and community growth. Token supports fees, buybacks, and utility. Launch delayed in mid-2024 due to market consolidation.
